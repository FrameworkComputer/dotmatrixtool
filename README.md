# Framework Laptop 16 LED Matrix Input Module

[View it in your browser.](https://ledmatrix.frame.work)

This little web app can directly connect to the Framework Laptop 16 LED matrix
input module. You need to be running a browser based on Chrome (Edge, Chromium,
Opera, etc.).

To start, simply open `index.html`. There is no server to run. If you want, you
can boot a simple web server with Python: `python3 -m http.server`

Use the "Connect Left" and "Connect Right" buttons to connect to each
respective input module. Draw on each input browser in your browser, and it
will automatically update the LED matrix.

Click and drag to draw, CTRL + click to erase.

Brightness can also be adjusted using the slider.
